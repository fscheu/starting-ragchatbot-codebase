Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models. These models enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Machine learning has applications in various fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. The field has grown rapidly in recent years due to increases in computational power and the availability of large datasets.

Lesson 1: Supervised Learning Basics

Supervised learning is one of the most common types of machine learning. In supervised learning, we train models using labeled data. The model learns from input-output pairs and can then make predictions on new, unseen data. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Each algorithm has its strengths and is suited for different types of problems.

Lesson 2: Unsupervised Learning Methods

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data. Clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique where similar data points are grouped together. K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering are two common approaches. Dimensionality reduction is another important unsupervised technique used to reduce the number of features while preserving important information.
